### Project: 
Analysis of scRNAseq experiment examining neuronal maturation in human and mouse cerebral organoids.<br>

### Analysis outline: 
1. Raw counts aligned to mixed reference genome.
2. Resulting counts matrix was the base for cell speicies annotation - demultiplexing.
3. Raw counts aligned to human and mouse reference genomes separately and identified human and mouse cell barcodes have been selected from each counts matricies respectively.
4. Quality control <br>
   *Removing cells with low feature and read numbers.<br>
   *Removing cells with high mitochodnrial and ribosomal fractions.<br>
   *Removing doublets.<br>
5. Dimentionality reduction and feature selection.
6. Clustering and cluster annotations by label transfer and marker expression.
7. Pseudotime alignment with MAGIC imputations.  


### Paper:
